        <h1>Zenitsu Agatsuma</h1>
        <h>Common description</h>
        <p>Zenitsu is a young guy with fair skin. He has golden brown eyes that are often downcast, and short yellow hair of varying lengths that turns orange towards the ends. Before becoming a fighter, his hair was black.

He wears a lighter brown version of the standard Demon Slayer uniform. On top of his uniform he wears a yellow and orange haori with a white triangle pattern. On his feet he puts on a pair of kyakhanas, which are tied with white bows. The design on them matches the design on his haori. </p>
    <p>Zenitsu is a coward. He believes that, due to the dangers of being a demon hunter, he does not have long to live, which is why he often pesters girls he meets, asking them to marry him. Zenitsu has low self-esteem, which prevents him from meeting other people's expectations and his own. This often causes him to lose faith in his abilities and, even when it is obvious, Zenitsu denies that he achieved victory with his own powers. He thinks his calling is to live a humble life, not to kill demons. Feeling difficulties or danger, he runs away, hides or simply cries

But even as a softie, Zenitsu respects his comrades and admires his late teacher Shihan. A sense of duty to him helps Zenitsu forget about fear and concentrate at the right moment. </p>
    <p>When Zenitsu was younger, he was in love with a girl who tricked him into collecting money to get rid of his debts. Because of her, Zenitsu got into trouble, but he was saved by the former pillar of thunder, Jigoro Kuwajima. To repay his debt, Zenitsu had to go through hellish training and become a demon slayer.

Zenitsu was under Shihan's tutelage and trained alongside his senior student Kaigaku. During one of his training sessions, Zenitsu climbed a tree because he didn't want to train anymore, and he was suddenly struck by lightning, causing his hair to turn blonde.</p>
    <p>Zenitsu has very sensitive hearing, which allows him to hear approaching danger. This ability works even in sleep. He can also hear people's thoughts if he uses his hearing to the fullest. Zenitsu becomes stronger when he falls unconscious. In a normal situation, excitement and fear paralyze him, but when his life is in danger, and the excitement and fear he experiences go beyond all limits, Zenitsu falls asleep, as if falling into a coma, and thereby awakens all his powers, which he masterfully uses, relying on his instincts . As the story progresses, Zenitsu gains more and more courage, which, together with constant training, gives him the opportunity to use his powers in his mind.</p>
    <p>Zenitsu wears a paler version of the standard Demon Slayer uniform, consisting of a dark brown jacket, a white belt around the waist and flared hakama pants, as well as his signature kimono with a white triangular pattern. In addition, Agatsuma wears a pair of kyahana tied at the front with three white bows in the same pattern as his kimono, light brown socks, and Japanese sandals with white laces. Zenitsu usually uses a regular katana with a yellowish blade.</p>
